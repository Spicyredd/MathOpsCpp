The code is terribly inefficient for now. This repository tracks my daily progress in improving performance, structure, and understanding.

Day 1: Baseline implementation.
Learned that std::vector in C++ behaves like Python’s list, offering dynamic resizing and contiguous memory storage. Implemented an algorithm to add two matrices with O(n²) time complexity.

Day 2: Matrix Transpose Implementation
Implemented a basic matrix transpose with vector data structure of C++.
